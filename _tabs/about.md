This is the blog for the site [Inciteful.xyz](https://inciteful.xyz). The goal of Inciteful is to give the world free tools to help accelerate academic research. If that means getting up to speed on a new topic, finding the latest literature, or figuring out how two ideas are connected, we can help.

Unlike a traditional search engine, citations are the cornerstone of all of our tools. Building these tools for all academic literature has only recently been possible with the rise of open scholarly bibliographic data and the amazing work being done by the these groups.

Being built off the backs of free and open data, we commit to paying it forward by keeping our own tools free for everyone.
